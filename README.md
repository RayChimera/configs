# General

Chimera's linux distro configs for new installations

> Use headings list to quickly jump to the section you need, Luke!

## Informational

### Common shortcuts

* :white_check_mark: - My default option for a tool where multiple options are available
* No checkmark - backup option for a tool (I consider switching to it probably or a legacy tool). I shouldn't install it if I'm not sure I want to switch right now

### Basic ideas

1. Install via OS package managers (not *Flatpak* or *Snap*, god forbid) if possible
1. Copy only things that are necessary

### Ideas for improvement

* [x] Make symlinks to configs in the repo instead of copying files for easier sync between computers in the future

> Check if it works as intended (the configs should update themselves in the repo)

* [ ] Turn it into a *Ansible* or at least a *bash* script
